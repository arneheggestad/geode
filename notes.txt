NOTES/ROADMAP

To implement:
- geocode by address (400 N Main St, Chattanooga, TN)
- geocode by intersection (Market and Main St, Chattanooga, TN)
- caching of results (with lookup prior to making an API call)
- get results using the geocoder.us API
- make own database for results?
- get results using other services
	- google, mapquest, ???

General thoughts:
- try to have good defaults so the calls don't have to contain all of the necessary information
	- at least city/state/country
- (optional) query validation 
- (optional) response validation -- Are the coordinates we're getting close to where we expect them to be, or are they really in South Dakota?
